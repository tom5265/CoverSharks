                    <p class="how-p">CoverSharks was founded by a group of college football fans who have been playing a fantasy sports game
                        called “Pick Six” for over a decade. As an alum and avid fan of the Crimson Tide, Bill Wilder first
                        created the original concept behind the game app in 2006. The idea was simple... give friends and
                        college football fans alike the opportunity to engage in their favorite sport using an innovative
                        format of game play that engages them in a unique, “game within the game” competition and enhances
                        the overall entertainment experience.</p>

        <p class="title-p">Over the past ten years, the players competing in the game have become part of a focus group that has seen vast potential
            in developing this unique format for play on a national scale. The number of players has steadily grown where
            the demand now exceeds the limits of the game. The game concept integrated with mobile app technology will make
            it available to sports fans across the country.</p>
